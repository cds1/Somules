This repository contains the various scripts necessary for the original analysis of the paper published in NatComms: Single-cell atlas of the first intra-mammalian developmental stage of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni.

The main purpose of this code is to document the details of the analysis methodology used in the paper.

1) Chromium 10X single-cell RNAseq is mapped using CellRanger. Please note that this part of the analysis was done by the core facility at the Sanger Institute. However, the code for CellRanger should be accessible from the 10X website. We encourange the reader to check this with 10X. 

2) The analysis of this dataset is carried out by Seurat. 

3) Please note that we provide some scripts that require files to be in a certain format. Nonetheless, the scripts should be provide the information if the reader would like to repeat the analysis.
